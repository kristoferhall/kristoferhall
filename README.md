## Kristofer Hall

I live with and among data. I do ecological, epidemiological, and healthcare data science/analytics. It's pretty rad. Passionate about machine learning, stats, AI, consciousness, and all the nitty gritty. 

<!--I am a data scientist/analyst and the Information Manager for the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Program based out of the University of New Mexico. -->
